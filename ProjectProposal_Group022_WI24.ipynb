    "COVID-19 has changed the life in many aspects. In response to COVID-19, many goverments issued mandatory stay-at-home policy. Boman and Gallupe (2020) found that the lockdown policy had some unintended impacts on the United States in which crime has decreased after the pandemic. However, after breaking down the crime categories, they found that the drop was driven by decreases in minor offenses, while serious crimes either remained constant or increased. \n",

On this one datasheet, there would ideally be 50 observations for each of the states, but for each state, there should be monthly average data for each of the variables (mentioned previously). The data would be collected by a credible source like the CDC or a governmental health agency, and this data would already be cleaned and stored in an Excel spreadsheet.\n",

    "For the first topic regarding the impact of COVID-19 across different areas within states, a potential dataset that could provide useful insights is the COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or state health departments. These datasets typically include information on the number of cases, deaths, demographics, and geographic location (such as county or zip code level) of COVID-19 patients. For example, [this data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/8396-v7yb/about_data) contains several columns like county, new cases, community transmission level, etc., which is a good dataset for us to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second topic regarding the correlation between types of crimes committed within California and their locations, a potential dataset that could be useful is the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program dataset provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the California Department of Justice. However, since there is an enormous amount of data available, more research needs to be conducted to find the appropriate datasets for our projects. In addition, obtaining detailed crime data at a granular level might be more challenging due to privacy concerns and data reporting practices of law enforcement agencies. Many data we have seen are presented as data tables rather than raw data, which is harder for us to analyze, especially coupled with COVID-19."
