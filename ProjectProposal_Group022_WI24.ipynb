    "COVID-19 has changed the life in many aspects. In response to COVID-19, many governments issued mandatory stay-at-home policies. Boman and Gallupe (2020) found that the lockdown policy had some unintended impacts on the United States in which crime had decreased after the pandemic. However, after breaking down the crime categories, they found that the drop was driven by decreases in minor offenses usually committed in peer groups, while serious crimes (e.g., homicide) either remained constant or increased. Because of the variability between different types of crimes, we decided to focus on just the violent crimes, which are defined by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and study the correlation between COVID-19 and violent crime rates across the states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous works looking at eight large US cities during the first few weeks of the pandemic found disparate impacts by crime type and location (Stickle & Felson, 2020). In order to have a better understanding of the correlation, we further narrowed down the location to one of the main states in the United States, California. Avila et al. (2023) examined the impact of COVID-19 on the violent crime rates in the city of Stockton, California, and they found that robbery and simple assault were increased while homicide and aggravated assult were not affected by the pandemic. The study further broke down the violent crimes and compared them across the categories in one city. The results provided insightful opinions for the local police departments. Instead of looking at one specific city, we want to examine the difference in the impacts across different cities in California and compare which city is mostly affected (violent crime rates increased the most after the pandemic), which may help to visualize the disparate impacts of COVID-19 in terms of violent crimes committed. \n",

    "Because California is the most populated state in the nation, we hypothesize that California was impacted the most due to COVID-19. Furthermore, because of COVID-19's rising unemployment rates and driving socioeconomic disparities even more, we hypothesize that there is a relationship between states more heavily impacted by COVID-19 and rising serious crime rates, and we’ll specifically see this in California’s data.

    "1. The ***ideal dataset*** would be one data sheet that has the death rate, hospitalization rate, vaccination rate, unemployment rate, average daily cases, and crime rates from March 2020 to December 2022 for all 50 states altogether. On this one datasheet, there would ideally be 50 observations for each of the states, but for each state, there should be monthly average data for each of the variables (mentioned previously). The data would be collected by a credible source like the CDC or a governmental health agency, and this data would already be cleaned and stored in an Excel spreadsheet.\n",

    "For the first topic regarding the impact of COVID-19 across different areas within states, a potential dataset that could provide useful insights is the COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or state health departments. These datasets typically include information on the number of cases, deaths, demographics, and geographic location (such as county or zip code level) of COVID-19 patients. For example, [this data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/8396-v7yb/about_data) contains several columns like county, new cases, community transmission level, etc., which is a good dataset for us to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second topic regarding the correlation between types of crimes committed within California and their locations, a potential dataset that could be useful is the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program dataset provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the California Department of Justice. However, since there is an enormous amount of data available, more research needs to be conducted to find the appropriate datasets for our projects. In addition, obtaining detailed crime data at a granular level might be more challenging due to privacy concerns and data reporting practices of law enforcement agencies. Many data we have seen are presented as data tables rather than raw data, which is harder for us to analyze, especially coupled with COVID-19."
