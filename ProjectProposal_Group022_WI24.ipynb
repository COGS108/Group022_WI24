    "COVID-19 has changed the life in many aspects. In response to COVID-19, many governments issued mandatory stay-at-home policies. Boman and Gallupe (2020) found that the lockdown policy had some unintended impacts on the United States in which crime had decreased after the pandemic. However, after breaking down the crime categories, they found that the drop was driven by decreases in minor offenses usually committed in peer groups, while serious crimes (e.g., homicide) either remained constant or increased. Because of the variability between different types of crimes, we decided to focus on just the violent crimes, which are defined by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and study the correlation between COVID-19 and violent crime rates across the states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous works looking at eight large US cities during the first few weeks of the pandemic found disparate impacts by crime type and location (Stickle & Felson, 2020). In order to have a better understanding of the correlation, we further narrowed down the location to one of the main states in the United States, California. Avila et al. (2023) examined the impact of COVID-19 on the violent crime rates in the city of Stockton, California, and they found that robbery and simple assault were increased while homicide and aggravated assult were not affected by the pandemic. The study further broke down the violent crimes and compared them across the categories in one city. The results provided insightful opinions for the local police departments. Instead of looking at one specific city, we want to examine the difference in the impacts across different cities in California and compare which city is mostly affected (violent crime rates increased the most after the pandemic), which may help to visualize the disparate impacts of COVID-19 in terms of violent crimes committed. \n",

    "Because California is the most populated state in the nation, we hypothesize that California was impacted the most due to COVID-19. Furthermore, because of COVID-19's rising unemployment rates and driving socioeconomic disparities even more, we hypothesize that there is a relationship between states more heavily impacted by COVID-19 and rising serious crime rates, and we’ll specifically see this in California’s data.

    "1. The ***ideal dataset*** would be one data sheet that has the death rate, hospitalization rate, vaccination rate, unemployment rate, average daily cases, and crime rates from March 2020 to December 2022 for all 50 states altogether. On this one datasheet, there would ideally be 50 observations for each of the states, but for each state, there should be monthly average data for each of the variables (mentioned previously). The data would be collected by a credible source like the CDC or a governmental health agency, and this data would already be cleaned and stored in an Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the first topic regarding the impact of COVID-19 across different areas within states, a potential dataset that could provide useful insights is the COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or state health departments. These datasets typically include information on the number of cases, deaths, demographics, and geographic location (such as county or zip code level) of COVID-19 patients. For example, [this data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/8396-v7yb/about_data) contains several columns like county, new cases, community transmission level, etc., which is a good dataset for us to analyze. For the second topic regarding the correlation between types of crimes committed within California and their locations, a potential dataset that could be useful is the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program dataset provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the California Department of Justice. However, since there is an enormous amount of data available, more research needs to be conducted to find the appropriate datasets for our projects. In addition, obtaining detailed crime data at a granular level might be more challenging due to privacy concerns and data reporting practices of law enforcement agencies. Many data we have seen are presented as data tables rather than raw data, which is harder for us to analyze, especially coupled with COVID-19."

    "In regards to potential ethical concerns of this project, there may be various biases depending on the specific dataset used. For crime data, it is likely that datasets are not reflective of all the crimes committed in a specific state or region but rather only those reported by the police. When conducting our analyses, we need to be aware of this potential collection bias as certain crimes may be underreported or overreported due to factors like law enforcement, community awareness campaigns, recent events, etc. Additionally, we need to consider many potential confounding variables in our analysis; for example, crime rates can vary based on geographical and demographic factors like population density, socioeconomic status, and cultural influences. Any correlations or associations found from our analyses may be due to a range of factors that may not be directly identified through our datasets. Similarly, for COVID-19 data, it is likely that datasets are subject to testing and reporting biases that are influenced by the availability and accessibility to testing resources and healthcare facilities in certain regions and populations. Differences in case definitions, data collection methods, and reporting protocols may create variations in the data cross regions. Confounding variables like asymptomatic cases, pre-existing health conditions, and public health interventions can also skew the measures of the “impact” of COVID-19. Keeping these considerations in mind, we can closely review how data was collected to see if certain groups were potentially overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset. We can also look for any inconsistencies, missing values, or data entry errors that potentially affect the integrity of the dataset and consider whether this is due to any systematic biases in data collection practices. Statistical techniques can also be used to detect patterns, outliers, and anomalies in the data and help control for confounding variables. Lastly, we can compare and cross-reference multiple datasets from different sources to validate our findings and identify potential biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in regards to privacy, no Personal Identifiable Information is being used because the data collected are more generalized by region. We should also keep in consideration that many crime and COVID-19 datasets are collected and maintained by law enforcement agencies or the government and therefore may be subject to terms of use agreements, restricting how data can be accessed or shared. Another general issue with this topic is data transparency as we want to ensure that findings in this research study avoid selective reporting or manipulation of data to fit a particular narrative. To address this, we should work to address any potential blindspots and work to mitigate any dataset bias such as stereotype perpetuation and confirmation bias. Another issue to consider is fairness and equity as a potential concern is that analyzing crime data in correlation with COVID-19 impact may reveal disparities in the distribution of resources, access to healthcare, and exposure to risk factors across marginalized populations. In our analysis, we should consider potential unintended consequences and prevent data from being misinterpreted or used to justify any discriminatory practices or policies."
