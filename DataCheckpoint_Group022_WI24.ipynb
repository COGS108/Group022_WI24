    "In March of 2020, the COVID-19 virus was labelled a pandemic, causing various parts of the world to undergo lockdown in an effort to try and combat this extremely transmissive virus. During this time, many countries had seen downward trends, with less people going to eat out, going to work, and generally travelling less. Our general research aims to find just how this virus impacted each of the 50 states across America.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a subtopic, we are also interested in finding out the impact of COVID-19 on the crime rates in the States as well, but specifically in California. We will be focusing on the rate of violent crimes (such as assault, murder, armed robbery, etc.), since studies have shown that minor offenses showed a downward trend, which was speculated to be because of the lockdowns keeping juvenile offenders indoors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of New Hampshire did a study on the economic impact of COVID, which shows an immediate drop in jobs across the United States at the start of the pandemic in Chart 1, and an upward trend immediately after, which started to slow down by the end of 2020 <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). As of 2021, Ettlinger has seen recovery in the economic status, with the unemployment rate going up in each state. While this is great news, Ettlinger notes that many industries have struggled to recover, such as the Leisure and Hospitality industry, which is reasonable given that at this point, many states were just getting out of lockdown. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are many links on the official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that provide datasets for the health impact per state in the United States. The CDC allows us to see the visualizations of categories like COVID patients, death rates, vaccination rates, and hospital admissions since August 1st, 2020. While this is just raw data, further data analysis would allow us to see data such as the net change in the number of hospitalizations in California. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our subtopic, Boman and Gallupe (2020) found that the lockdown policy had some unintended impacts on the United States in which crime had decreased after the pandemic. However, after breaking down the crime categories, they found that the drop was driven by decreases in minor offenses usually committed in peer groups, while serious crimes (e.g., homicide) either remained constant or increased. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-3)Because of the variability between different types of crimes, we decided to focus on just the violent crimes, which are defined by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and study the correlation between COVID-19 and violent crime rates across the states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous works looking at eight large US cities during the first few weeks of the pandemic found disparate impacts by crime type and location (Stickle & Felson, 2020). <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)In order to have a better understanding of the correlation, we further narrowed down the location to one of the main states in the United States, California. Avila et al. (2023)<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) examined the impact of COVID-19 on the violent crime rates in the city of Stockton, California, and they found that robbery and simple assault were increased while homicide and aggravated assult were not affected by the pandemic. The study further broke down the violent crimes and compared them across the categories in one city. The results provided insightful opinions for the local police departments. Instead of looking at one specific city, we want to examine the difference in the impacts across different cities in California and compare which city is mostly affected (violent crime rates increased the most after the pandemic), which may help to visualize the disparate impacts of COVID-19 in terms of violent crimes committed. \n",

    "- Description: \n",
    "    - The dataset below is from to California Department of Public Health and contains data about the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and positive tests across all the counties in California between 02/01/2020 to 12/19/2023. \n",
    "- Variables and their datatypes:\n",
    "    - The main varibales that we are interested in analyzing are 'cumulative_cases' (`float64` type), 'cumulative_deaths' (`float64` type), 'cumulative_total_tests' (`int64` type), 'cumulative_positive_tests' (`int64` type). 'date' and 'area' are included as well which are of `object` type, and for area, which in this dataset is synonymous with county, is limited to the top 15 most populated counties in California, and this has been consistent amongst all our dataset. 'population' (also `float64` type) is kept as a potential important and useful factor for analysis in the future. \n",
    "- Concepts:\n",
    "    - In general, these variables reveal the total most updated number of cases, deaths, total tests, and positive tests in these counties on each date of 02/01/2020 to 12/19/2023. This will help us further determine further if a county was more affected by COVID-19 than other counties, along with our other factors too for the COVID-19 part of our research question\n",
    "- Wrangling/Cleaning/Preprocessing the dataset:\n",
    "    - To begin our initial wrangling, we plan to first just pull out all the data for our variables, counties, and dates of interest (as shown below) and thus condensing the dataset down to 11415 rows × 7 columns. Because we have multiple datasets for COVID-19, we plan to do the same process for all the COVID-19 dataset, eventually combining all these into one dataframe to simplify and increase the efficiency of future analysis.\n"

    "In regards to potential ethical concerns of this project, there may be various biases depending on the specific dataset used. For crime data, it is likely that datasets are not reflective of all the crimes committed in a specific state or region but rather only those reported by the police. When conducting our analyses, we need to be aware of this potential collection bias as certain crimes may be underreported or overreported due to factors like law enforcement, community awareness campaigns, recent events, etc. Additionally, we need to consider many potential confounding variables in our analysis; for example, crime rates can vary based on geographical and demographic factors like population density, socioeconomic status, and cultural influences. Any correlations or associations found from our analyses may be due to a range of factors that may not be directly identified through our datasets. Similarly, for COVID-19 data, it is likely that datasets are subject to testing and reporting biases that are influenced by the availability and accessibility to testing resources and healthcare facilities in certain regions and populations. Differences in case definitions, data collection methods, and reporting protocols may create variations in the data cross regions. Confounding variables like asymptomatic cases, pre-existing health conditions, and public health interventions can also skew the measures of the “impact” of COVID-19. Keeping these considerations in mind, we can closely review how data was collected to see if certain groups were potentially overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset. We can also look for any inconsistencies, missing values, or data entry errors that potentially affect the integrity of the dataset and consider whether this is due to any systematic biases in data collection practices. Statistical techniques can also be used to detect patterns, outliers, and anomalies in the data and help control for confounding variables. Lastly, we can compare and cross-reference multiple datasets from different sources to validate our findings and identify potential biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in regards to privacy, no Personal Identifiable Information is being used because the data collected are more generalized by region. We should also keep in consideration that many crime and COVID-19 datasets are collected and maintained by law enforcement agencies or the government and therefore may be subject to terms of use agreements, restricting how data can be accessed or shared. Another general issue with this topic is data transparency as we want to ensure that findings in this research study avoid selective reporting or manipulation of data to fit a particular narrative. To address this, we should work to address any potential blindspots and work to mitigate any dataset bias such as stereotype perpetuation and confirmation bias. Another issue to consider is fairness and equity as a potential concern is that analyzing crime data in correlation with COVID-19 impact may reveal disparities in the distribution of resources, access to healthcare, and exposure to risk factors across marginalized populations. In our analysis, we should consider potential unintended consequences and prevent data from being misinterpreted or used to justify any discriminatory practices or policies."
