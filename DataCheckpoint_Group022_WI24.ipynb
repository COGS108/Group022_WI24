    "The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous effects in many aspects of life, from social connections to physical and mental health. Among its less apparent interpersonal and political impacts are those on crime rates. Existing research and analyses reveal a comprehensive picture: while the pandemic has led to substantial shifts in crime rates compared to pre-pandemic times, the direction and scale of these changes vary depending on the type of crime. Our research aims to investigate these dynamics, particularly focusing on the trends in violent crime rates in correlation with various COVID-19 data in California. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FBI both reported a striking 30 percent increase in the number of homicides in the U.S. from 2019 to 2020, marking the largest single-year increase on record.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) According to a study by the Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ), this surge likely stemmed from a combination of factors, including the pandemic and social unrest.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) This study also highlights increases in aggravated and gun assaults and motor vehicle thefts, juxtaposed with declines in residential and non-residential burglaries, larcenies, and drug offenses. Recent data reveals that there was a significant 2% decline in violent crime in the U.S., approaching pre-pandemic rates.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) However, these studies note that it is unclear if these fluctuations in crime rate can be attributed to the pandemic. In our project, we aim to analyze COVID-19 data to see if there are significant correlations that can potentially help explain and predict these trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we focus on analyzing data in California as findings reveal a notable widening of the gap between the state’s violent crime rates and the national average during the pandemic.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This disparity increased significantly from 15% in 2019 to 31% in 2022. Surprisingly, this surge is not correlated with the national increase in homicide rates but rather due to a rise in aggravated assaults within the state. Moreover, the Public Policy Institute of California indicates that the violent crime rates across counties varies, with 36 out of 58 witnessing a surge in 2022, 13 of which increasing by 20% or more. With this research, we’re interested in further analyzing violent crime rates in California to identify potential correlations with COVID-19. Are the shifts in crime rate truly attributed to the pandemic or merely an overlap in timing? Moreover, are these correlations consistent across the state or confined to specific counties? To answer these questions, we look at three major indicators of COVID-19: hospitalization rates, overall cases, and vaccination rates. Going a step further, we want to see if we can potentially predict the rise or fall of violent crime rates given the upward or downward trends of the pandemic.\n",

Then, we will be able to plot the COVID and Crime datasets together to see if there is a correlation between the effect of COVID and the given crime rate. To simplify our datasets just a little bit, we decided to use the 15 most populous counties in California, since there is likely to be more data for both crime and COVID rates. \n",

    "- Description: \n",
    "    - The dataset below is from to California Department of Public Health and contains data about the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and positive tests across all the counties in California between 02/01/2020 to 12/19/2023. \n",
    "- Variables and their datatypes:\n",
    "    - The main varibales that we are interested in analyzing are 'cumulative_cases' (`float64` type), 'cumulative_deaths' (`float64` type), 'cumulative_total_tests' (`int64` type), 'cumulative_positive_tests' (`int64` type). 'date' and 'area' are included as well which are of `object` type, and for area, which in this dataset is synonymous with county, is limited to the top 15 most populated counties in California, and this has been consistent amongst all our dataset. 'population' (also `float64` type) is kept as a potential important and useful factor for analysis in the future. \n",
    "- Concepts:\n",
    "    - In general, these variables reveal the total most updated number of cases, deaths, total tests, and positive tests in these counties on each date of 02/01/2020 to 12/19/2023. This will help us further determine further if a county was more affected by COVID-19 than other counties, along with our other factors too for the COVID-19 part of our research question\n",
    "- Wrangling/Cleaning/Preprocessing the dataset:\n",
    "    - To begin our initial wrangling, we plan to first just pull out all the data for our variables, counties, and dates of interest (as shown below) and thus condensing the dataset down to 11415 rows × 7 columns. Because we have multiple datasets for COVID-19, we plan to do the same process for all the COVID-19 dataset, eventually combining all these into one dataframe to simplify and increase the efficiency of future analysis.\n"

    "    - **hospitalized_covid_patients** (float64): The number of patients currently hospitalized in an inpatient bed who have suspected or confirmed COVID.\n",
    "    - **all_hospital_beds** (float64): The total number of beds in the facility, including all surge beds, inpatient and outpatient post-surgical beds, labor and delivery unit beds, and observation beds.\n",

    "- Wrangling/Cleaning/Preprocessing the dataset:\n",
    "    - We first removed \"_id\" column because it is the same as the index, and then we converted \"todays_date\" into pd.Timestamp datatype for us to select the time range we want. Then, we keeped the data in the top 15 populated counties."

    "    - This dataset includes the vaccination counts in each county in California from 2020 to 2024. The vaccination counts are further broken down into partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated, and at least one dose. Except for the \"county\" and \"administered_date\" variables, which are \"objects\", all other variables are integers.\n",
    "- Relevant to the research question\n",
    "    - The vaccination rates provide insight into the Covid-19 situation in each county, which may be correlated to the Covid-19 cases and further related to the violent crime rates. The vaccination rate could be a counfounder or a mediator, or has nothing to do with the relationship, and this need to be further analyzed. \n",
    "- Data cleaning & wrangling\n",
    "    - Visualize the change in vaccination rate (at least one dose vs. partially vaccinated vs. fully vaccinated) in different county & compare the change across the counties. Also, analyze the vaccination rates by calculating the proportion in relation to the county's total population. Visualize the change in proportions. Planning to merge this dataset with other Covid-19 related datasets including total cases and hospitalization. "

    "In regards to potential ethical concerns of this project, there may be various biases depending on the specific dataset used. For crime data, it is likely that datasets are not reflective of all the crimes committed in a specific county but rather only those reported by the police. When conducting our analyses, we need to be aware of this potential collection bias as certain crimes may be underreported or overreported due to factors like law enforcement, community awareness campaigns, recent events, etc. Additionally, we need to consider many potential confounding variables in our analysis; for example, crime rates can vary based on geographical and demographic factors like population density, socioeconomic status, and cultural influences. Any correlations or associations found from our analyses may be due to a range of factors that may not be directly identified through our datasets. Similarly, for COVID-19 data, it is likely that datasets are subject to testing and reporting biases that are influenced by the availability and accessibility to testing resources and healthcare facilities in certain regions and populations. Differences in case definitions, data collection methods, and reporting protocols may create variations in the data cross regions. Confounding variables like asymptomatic cases, pre-existing health conditions, and public health interventions can also skew the measures of the “impact” of COVID-19. Keeping these considerations in mind, we can closely review how data was collected to see if certain groups were potentially overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset. We can also look for any inconsistencies, missing values, or data entry errors that potentially affect the integrity of the dataset and consider whether this is due to any systematic biases in data collection practices. Statistical techniques can also be used to detect patterns, outliers, and anomalies in the data and help control for confounding variables. Lastly, we can compare and cross-reference multiple datasets from different sources to validate our findings and identify potential biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in regards to privacy, no Personal Identifiable Information is being used because the data collected are more generalized by region. We should also keep in consideration that many crime and COVID-19 datasets are collected and maintained by law enforcement agencies or the government and therefore may be subject to terms of use agreements, restricting how data can be accessed or shared. Another general issue with this topic is data transparency as we want to ensure that findings in this research study avoid selective reporting or manipulation of data to fit a particular narrative. To address this, we should work to address any potential blindspots and work to mitigate any dataset bias such as stereotype perpetuation and confirmation bias. Another issue to consider is fairness and equity as a potential concern is that analyzing crime data in correlation with COVID-19 impact may reveal disparities in the distribution of resources, access to healthcare, and exposure to risk factors across marginalized populations. In our analysis, we should consider potential unintended consequences and prevent data from being misinterpreted or used to justify any discriminatory practices or policies."
